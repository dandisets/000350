description: 'When a behavior repeatedly fails to achieve its goal, animals often
  give up and become passive, which can be strategic for preserving energy or regrouping
  between attempts. It is unknown how the brain identifies behavioral failures and
  mediates this behavioral-state switch. In larval zebrafish swimming in virtual reality,
  visual feedback can be withheld so that swim attempts fail to trigger expected visual
  flow. After tens of seconds of such motor futility, animals became passive for similar
  durations. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed noradrenergic neurons that responded
  specifically to failed swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium levels
  accumulated with increasing numbers of failed attempts. Using cell ablation and
  optogenetic or chemogenetic activation, we found that noradrenergic neurons progressively
  activated brainstem radial astrocytes, which then suppressed swimming. Thus, radial
  astrocytes perform a computation critical for behavior: they accumulate evidence
  that current actions are ineffective and consequently drive changes in behavioral
  states.'
